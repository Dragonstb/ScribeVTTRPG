The buzz words used within this project. They are also definistions. Thus, please use these words wherever aprobiate.

**GM:** The game master, a participant in a game with elaborated rights. She/he can edit and modify any *handout*, move
 any *token* to wherever she likes, and roll dice till the end of days. She/he may grant the right to players to see
 handouts and/or move tokens. The GM may withdraw these rights as she/he likes it (and regrant, rewithdraw, reregrant,
...).

**http session:** The http session that relates consecutive http requests to a sibgle person. To be differentiated from
the *session*, which is a bunch pf people having found together and playing their game.

**participant:** Groups all kind of participants in a *session* together. Thus, a *gm*, a *player*, or a *spectator*.

**player:** A participant in a game with limited rights. He/she can see only the handouts the *GM* allowes to be seen by
the player. The player can only move *tokens* for that he/she has got the right to do so. A player may roll at free
will.

**session:** A gaming session. Here, the participants, namely the *GM*, the *players*, and the *spectators*, virtually
sit together in a *room* and play their table top role playing game. If we speak of the http session the server takes
care of, we use *http session*.

**spectator:** A participant of the game with very little rights. She/he can only see handouts the *GM* has made
 visible to spectators. Spectators never can move any token, nor can they roll any dice.
