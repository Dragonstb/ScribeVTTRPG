# Joining games

### Participant browsing to a *session*

- just has to enter the URL of the *room* (like www.example.com/game/whatever-room-name-the-gm-set).
- gets a join screen (if URL is correct) that asks for the person's name and, only if set, the password of the *session*.
- hitting the "join" button forwards the *participant* to a "please wait for GM" screen.
- *participant*'s name is added to the list of waiting players in the GM's main menu
- entering an invalid *room* name or a nonexisting *room* name redirects the failed *participant* to a page stating that
  the room is either "404 not found" or "410 gone".

### GM decides on waiting *paticipants*

- in his/her main menu of the game screen, GM has a list of potential *participants* that have requested to join the *room*.
- for each waiting potential *participant*, GM can choose one of three options: let join as *player*, let join as
  *spectator*, decline
- if accepted, the *participant* is automatically forwarded to the game screen in her/his assigned role. All handouts
  are "hidden"
- if declined, the failed *participant* is forwarded to a "sorry" page

# Handouts

### rearrange handouts

- buttons "up" and "down" can move a handout item up and down within its container.
- *players* can always rearrange the handouts they can see.

### add handout item

- a button "add" at the end of each containr allows for adding a new handout item to the container.
- GM can always add handout items in any container.
- items added by GM can be seen only by the GM himself/herself.
- items added by GM can only be edited by the GM
- *players* can add handout items to any container they can see.
- an item added by a *player* can only be seen and edited by the *player* herself/himself and by the GM.
- any item added is also added to the GM's general material database, and it is added as content of the current campaign.

### Modifying read/write rights

- for each handout item, the GM has an option menu for setting the access rights for each *player* individually, and for
  the group of *spectators*.
- for each player, the menu contains a line with the name and a button group of three radio buttons, corresponding to
  "hidden", "visible", and "editable". Exactly one of these three radio buttons is activated at any time.
- a last line is for the *spectators*, with only the two radio buttons "hidden" and "visible"
