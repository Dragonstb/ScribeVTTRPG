Some user stories explaining how ScribeVTTRPG is used and how it works.

# GM starts a new session

The GM needs an account on the service.

1. The GM navigates to the homepage
2. After successfully logging in, he/she ends up on a web page called his/her "personal hall". Among other options, all
campaigns led by the GM are listed here.
3. The GM looks for the campaign she/he wants to open a new session for. On the tile of that campaign, she/he clicks on
"Start Session".
4. A dialog for creating a new session opens. Here, the GM enters a room name and, optionally, a password.
5. After hitting "Start Session", if the entered room name is still available, the room opens. It is available on the
 path "/games/whateverthegmenteredasroomname". The GM is also ushered into the room by the web service immediately. The
GM's role in the session is "GM".

# A player joins a session

A player who knows the link does not need to authenticate or even register for joining the game.

1. The GM sends the path of the room, and also the password if set, to all his/her friends he/she wanna invite.
2. The player enters the address of the room in the browser.
3. On a welcome form, the player can enter a name and, if set by the GM, the password. If completed, she/he clicks the
"join" button and is redirected to a waiting page.
4. The GM is informed about the new guest. He/she may choose to let the new person in as a player, as a spectator, or
reject the join request.
5. If accepted, the guest enters the game. If declined she/he is presented with a sorry page.

# Distributing material to the players

1. A new player joins the game. He/she wanna play a certain character.
2. The GM makes this character's character sheet available to the player. She/he can see the handouts now. Where the
configuration of the handout allows for it, the player can edit fields of the handout (like reducing the HP after
receiving a devastating blow from an orc).
3. Also, modification rights for some tokens may be granted by the GM to the player. As a consequence, the player can
move these tokens around.

# Rolling dice

tbd :(


# Powers of the GM, the players, and the spectators in a game

- The GM has access to all handouts (this, especially, includes the character sheets). He/she can determine individually
whom of the players can see which handout. Also, the GM can decide if the spectators can see a certain handout.
- Players can edit all editable fields on handouts they can see. They also can add new fields to a handout, wherever a
handout is configured this way. A player may add a new skill to her/his character sheet, for example. The GM can edit
any handout at any time. Spectators, on the other hand, have read only access to handouts they can see.
